INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT DEVELOPER

Goal: Merge the timeline dashboard view, sidebar menu, and project board into one seamless interface. The user wants a unified mobile-first design where all project boards are organized under one main dashboard, and each board can be expanded like a folder/file explorer.

STRUCTURE & FUNCTIONALITY

1. Main Dashboard Layout
	•	Mobile-first layout using Flexbox/Grid + media queries.
	•	Left sidebar as collapsible drawer (hamburger icon for mobile).
	•	Center panel shows:
	•	“Project Boards” section with drop-down folders.
	•	Each folder = project board.
	•	Timeline summary bar is shown at the top (optional toggle).
	•	Tap folder/project board → expands to full board table view underneath.

2. Sidebar (Shared Navigation)
	•	Display icon + label:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Teams
	•	Calendar
	•	Time Tracker
	•	My Tasks
	•	Settings
	•	Under that, show:
	•	List of workspaces/projects
	•	“+” button to add a new board or folder (opens modal)

3. Project Board Integration
	•	Each board is a folder view (like macOS Finder or Google Drive).
	•	On tap, the board drops down to display the Monday.com-style table with:
	•	Main items
	•	Sub-items
	•	Column types: status, people, due date, done, progress, etc.
	•	Boards should retain smart fields, formulas, and column types across sessions.
	•	New boards created should automatically be added to the dropdown view under “Project Boards.”

FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR

Add Buttons:
	•	Each dropdown folder includes:
	•	+ Add Item (row)
	•	+ Add Sub Item
	•	+ Add Folder (creates new project board)

Data Behavior:
	•	All added data must be saved persistently using your DB (Supabase, Firebase, etc.).
	•	When new columns are added, auto-align rows across all items.
	•	Column header types should auto-populate fields so each row is aligned and editable.

Mobile Optimization:
	•	Tap interface (no hover reliance).
	•	Column headers scroll horizontally (sticky top for column names).
	•	Rows are collapsible to reduce screen clutter.
	•	Timeline view adjusts to stacked view on small screens
