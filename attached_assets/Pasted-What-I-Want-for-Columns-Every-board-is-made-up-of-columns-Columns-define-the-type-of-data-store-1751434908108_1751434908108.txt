What I Want for Columns:
	•	Every board is made up of columns.
Columns define the type of data stored for each item and subitem (rows).
	•	Columns are fully customizable:
	•	Users can add, remove, hide, and reorder columns.
	•	Columns can be renamed and their type can be changed at any time.
	•	Support all Monday.com column types:
	•	Text, Long Text, Status, Dropdown, Number, Date, Timeline, People, Tags, Files, Link, Email, Phone, Checkbox, Rating, Location, Formula, Progress, Auto Number, Mirror, Dependency, Vote, Creation Log, Last Updated, etc.
	•	Every column type should match Monday.com’s behavior:
	•	For example, a Status column has color-coded labels; a People column assigns users; a File column supports attachments; a Formula column computes values live.
	•	Columns are visible and editable both in main items and in subitems (subitems use the same or their own set of columns).
	•	Easy, inline editing:
	•	Users should be able to edit column values directly in the table (no popups or new screens needed).
	•	Flexible order and visibility:
	•	Users can drag columns to change their order, show/hide columns as needed, and save custom views.
	•	Column settings:
	•	Each column type can have settings (for example: status options and colors, date formats, formula definitions, etc.).
	•	Add columns anytime:
	•	Users can insert a new column at any position.
	•	Remove or hide columns:
	•	Users can hide columns (just for themselves, or board-wide), or remove them entirely.

Behavior Details:
	•	When adding a new column, prompt for type and name.
	•	Columns should be available to both main items and subitems.
	•	Editing a cell should update instantly.
	•	Column values should be saved per item/subitem (cell-based, not just row-based).
	•	Formula columns recalculate in real time based on referenced columns.
	•	Columns can be used as triggers for automations, filters, or formulas.

⸻

Data Structure:
	•	Columns are defined in a separate table/model and assigned to boards.
	•	Each column has:
	•	A unique ID, name, type, settings/config
	•	Position/order
	•	Visibility status
	•	Each item/subitem stores its own cell value for every column.
