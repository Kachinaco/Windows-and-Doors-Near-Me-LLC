I want to expand the project board by improving the existing columns and adding new ones to make the system more functional and dynamic.

🔧 Improve Existing Columns

(These are already in place, but I’d like them to be more flexible or feature-rich — please optimize them):
	•	Main Item
	•	Status
	•	Assigned To
	•	Date-Time

Please make sure:
	•	Status supports color-coded tags and customizable options
	•	Assigned To pulls from project team members
	•	Date-Time supports full calendar view and timezone sync

➕ Add These Columns:

General Tracking Columns
	•	✅ Checkbox – for marking done/incomplete tasks
	•	🔢 Auto Number – for automatically generating unique ID per row
	•	🆔 Item ID – custom ID field, editable or view-only
	•	🕒 Timeline – visual timeline bar view across dates
	•	📊 Progress Tracking – bar that fills based on sub-item or task completion
	•	🧮 Formula – calculates values based on other column inputs
	•	📅 Week – week-of-year or week-range picker
	•	🌍 World Clock – set per user/time zone reference

Communication + Team
	•	📧 Email – formatted input, auto-links to mailto:
	•	📞 Phone – formatted input for US/international numbers
	•	📍 Location – address or lat/long, optional Google Maps preview
	•	🔗 Link – live clickable URL with custom text
	•	🌐 Custom URL – a dynamic link using project variables (e.g., https://mydomain.com/job/{{item.id}})
	•	👥 Team – drop-down to assign to a team, not just a person
	•	🗳️ Vote – allow users to vote on a row/task
	•	🎨 Color Picker – select custom color for tagging or visual categories

Workflow + System
	•	🗂️ Files – upload files (PDF, images, docs, etc.)
	•	📝 Creation Log – shows who created the item and when
	•	🔄 Last Updated – shows who last edited and when
	•	⏱️ Time Tracking – start/stop timers or manual time entry per item
	•	🔌 API Action – trigger an API webhook from a row
	•	🌐 Country – dropdown of countries, searchable

Let me know if any of these need to be broken down or designed differently in the UI. I’d like all of these to be addable from the “+ Add Column” dropdown and usable on both Main Items and Sub Items
